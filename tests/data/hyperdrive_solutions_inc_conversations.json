If you have an astromech droid, run a diagnostic on the primary power couplings. Otherwise, revert to realspace and attempt a cold reboot of the navicomputer. If the issue persists, bring your ship to the nearest Hyperdrive Solutions service station—we have technicians stationed at major spaceports like Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant." }

Check your ship’s power distribution settings—if you have an R-series astromech, you can adjust power allocation in-flight. Otherwise, consider upgrading your power cells or installing a capacitor buffer to balance energy flow. If you need custom modifications, our certified technicians at the Corellian Shipyards can assist!" }

Try resetting the droid's interface module by performing a hard reboot—hold down its primary power switch for 10 seconds. If the issue persists, it might be a compatibility issue with your ship’s firmware. Bring it to one of our service stations, or try updating your flight software via the Holonet." }
